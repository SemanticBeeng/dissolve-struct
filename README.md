dissolve<sup>struct</sup>
===========

Distributed solver library for structured output prediction, based on Spark.

The library is based on the primal-dual BCFW solver, allowing approximate inference oracles, and distributes this algorithm using the recent communication efficient CoCoA scheme.
The interface to the user is the same as in the widely used SVM<sup>struct</sup> in the single machine case.

# Usage

#### Checkout the project repository

	git clone https://github.com/dalab/dissolve-struct.git

## Running the examples
In order to run the examples, the solver package needs to be built and published locally first:
```bash
cd dissolve-struct-lib
sbt publish-local
```
This is followed by building the example package:
```bash
cd dissolve-struct-examples
sbt package
```

Obtain the datasets by:
```bash
cd data
bash retrieve_datasets.sh
python convert-ocr-data.py
```
(you might have to install `brew install sbt` and `brew install wget` first if on a mac)

### Executing through command line
Download the [pre-build binary package of Spark](http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html). Here for example we assume the Spark folder is named `spark-1.2.0`.

##### Binary classification Example
Training a binary SVM locally from the command-line is done as follows, here for the Forest Cover (COV) dataset. Within `dissolve-struct-examples` directory, run
```bash
spark-1.2.0/bin/spark-submit --jars ../dissolve-struct-lib/target/scala-2.10/dissolvestruct_2.10-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --class "ch.ethz.dalab.dissolve.examples.binaryclassification.COVBinary" --master local --driver-memory 2G target/scala-2.10/dissolvestructexample_2.10-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

##### Sequence Prediction with OCR data
Training a chain structured SVM model on the [OCR dataset](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~taskar/ocr/). This example uses the Viterbi algorithm for the decoding oracle:
```bash
spark-1.2.0/bin/spark-submit --jars ../dissolve-struct-lib/target/scala-2.10/dissolvestruct_2.10-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --class "ch.ethz.dalab.dissolve.examples.chain.ChainDemo" --master local --driver-memory 2G target/scala-2.10/dissolvestructexample_2.10-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Here is the same example using more general Belief Propagation, by employing the [Factorie library](http://factorie.cs.umass.edu/) (Requires [Factorie 1.0 Jar](https://github.com/factorie/factorie/releases) to be placed within `dissolve-struct-examples/lib` directory):
```bash
spark-1.2.0/bin/spark-submit --jars ../dissolve-struct-lib/target/scala-2.10/dissolvestruct_2.10-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar,lib/factorie-1.0.jar --class "ch.ethz.dalab.dissolve.examples.chain.ChainBPDemo" --master local --driver-memory 2G target/scala-2.10/dissolvestructexample_2.10-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Executing within Eclipse
To ease debugging and development, the examples can directly be run within Eclipse by `Run As | Scala Application`. This does not require Spark binaries. See the section below how to set up the environment.

Within Eclipse, Spark can only be run in local mode since all the interactions need to be visible to Eclipse.
In order to enable this, the `SparkContext` needs to be initialized by setting the master to `local`:
```scala
val conf = new SparkConf()
	       .setAppName("COV-example")
	       .setMaster("local[4]")
```

## Setting up a development environment
To import the packages in [Eclipse for Scala](http://scala-ide.org/download/sdk.html), the respective .classpath files needs to be generated for the `dissolve-struct-lib`:
```bash
cd dissolve-struct-lib
sbt eclipse
```
Similarly, for `dissolve-struct-examples` package too:
```bash
cd dissolve-struct-examples
sbt eclipse
```
The above packages can be imported individually into Eclipse using: `File | Import | Existing Projects into Workspace`. Make sure you have `search for nested projects` checked, so you'll have the choice to select both the `dissolve-struct-lib` and `dissolve-struct-examples` projects, if desired.

Currently Scala 2.10.4 is required by Spark. If Eclipse defaults to Scala 2.11 instead, this can cause an error "cross-compiled with an incompatible version of Scala".
The correct version needs to be set for both the projects by:
`Project Properties | Scala Compiler | Setting "Scala Installation" to "Latest 2.10 bundle"`.
Alternatively, we recommend directly working with Eclipse IDE for Scala 2.10.4 from <http://scala-ide.org/download/sdk.html>.
