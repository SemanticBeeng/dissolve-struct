\section{Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}

Run experiments on one or two standard structured prediction tasks.

\paragraph{Experiment 1:} 
scaling number of machines, on same dataset.

\paragraph{Experiment 2:}
cocoa+-bcfw vs standard distributed mini-batch SGD


(Compare to other frameworks... ? most are just single machine. could include to show more insights on our single machine performance as well)
